#### _Raspberry Pi 3_
  + Period: October 14th, 2020 ~ November 2nd, 2020
  + Install env: Raspbian, Python IDE
  + Project 1: Sensor vehicle (4 people)
    - Make sensortive vehicle using ltrasonic Sensor that recognize distance between themself(driver) and object.
    - Project period: 10 days
    - Jobs in team: Development(Python3 IDE + RPi.GPIO module), Manage tools, Construct sensor vehicle, Make PPT
    - This project's goal is implemented for making auto-driving car. Because of the short period for ready project, we finally concluded to make sensor car.
    - If we had more times such as five or more days, we will maybe ready to get data rotated-angle using stepper-motor and implement to line-detecting skills.

  + Project 2: Raspi WiFi RC Car (5 people)
    - Make car using android application for automatic & manual control
      - automatic: The car recognizes a line and cross-load and self-drive position of user command.
      - manual: The car is driven by user's application joystick(control direction).
    - Project period: 14 days
    - Jobs in team: Development(Python3 IDE + RPi.GPIO module), Make PPT, Make application(intro)
